<div class="headline"><h2>ACHIA work packages</h2></div>

ACHIA is designed to create an interdisciplinary approach to the impacts of climate change on health through air quality changes, and to start longer‐term collaborations between communities. We expect the project to advance state of art across all working groups (WGs), with important implications for research groups around the world. A particular innovation of the project is the multi‐scale aspect, i.e., the analysis of climate, air quality and health at the global, regional and urban scales using consistent methodologies. Comparison of health findings across scales will provide unique insights into the importance of geographic scale in assessing health impacts of alternative climate and air quality scenarios.

<h4 class="color-green">WG1. Global Climate and Air Pollution Impacts of Alternative Emissions Pathways</h4>

Projections of climate and air quality (PM2.5 and ozone) at the global scale are being developed with the LMDz‐ INCA global model, run using the four IPCC representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for the 2030 to 2050 time horizon. Model outputs will be available at a spatial resolution of 3.75° in longitude and 1.9° in latitude. Comparison across the RCPs will answer the question, “what are the global health implications of various greenhouse gas control policies?”

<h3>WG2. Climate and Air Quality at Regional and Urban Scales: results for Europe and Paris</h3>

Here we develop projections of temperatures and air pollution concentrations at a 50x50 km2 scale over Europe, and at a 4x4 km2 scale over the Paris region using new multi‐scale air quality projections that will be driven by the same RCPs as above based on the international coordinated programs CMIP5 and CORDEX. Deterministic, statistical and semi‐empirical methods will be developed to downscale the large scale air‐quality model (WG1) to regional (countries and regions) and urban scale grids. Emission projections will be adjusted to be consistent with the global RCPs and/or European and Parisian emissions targets. These results will be of direct value to national and local decision makers in quantifying health benefits of global and regional emissions pathways.

<h3>WG3. Health Impact Assessment</h3>

This work package is responsible for adapting, developing and applying state of the art health impact modelling tools within the overall objectives of the project. WG3 will use the air quality model outputs from WG1 and WG2 in combination with other relevant inputs (concentration‐response functions, populations, and cause‐specific mortality rates) to compute estimates of ozone‐ and PM2.5‐attributed mortality under alternative emissions scenarios at the global, regional and urban scales. WG3 will adapt HIA guidelines developed in the APHEKOM project for use with modeled data. It will take into account demographic projections to estimates future population and health data.

<h3>WG4. Dissemination, evaluation, management</h3>

This WG is responsible for overall project coordination and management. In addition, it is responsible for communicating goals, progress, and results of the project with outside parties, including policy makers. In addition, it will be responsible for evaluating the success of the project.
